# Detailed Implementation Plan for OKmusi-like Music Streaming Website

This project will be implemented using Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. The following plan outlines file modifications, new file creations, error handling practices, and UI/UX considerations for a modern, responsive, and fully functional music streaming application.

---

## 1. Environment & Global Setup

- **.env.local:**  
  - Create or update this file with necessary environment variables (e.g., MUSIC_API_KEY, DATABASE_URL).  
  - Use fallback values for demo/mock data if API keys are not provided.

- **tailwind.config.js:**  
  - Create this file if not present. Configure Tailwind CSS with custom themes, spacing, and typography to enforce a modern UI.
  
- **src/app/globals.css:**  
  - Import Tailwind’s base, components, and utilities.  
  - Add global error and loading state CSS classes.

---

## 2. Pages Creation

- **Home Page – `src/app/page.tsx`:**
  - Render a hero section with a modern search bar (using our custom `<SearchBar />` component).  
  - Include brief descriptive text and call-to-action for login/signup.

- **Search Results Page – `src/app/search/page.tsx`:**
  - Retrieve query parameters and call the `/api/music` endpoint for song, artist, or album searches.  
  - Display results responsively using card layouts with clear typography and spacing.

- **Music Player Page – `src/app/player/page.tsx`:**
  - Embed the `<MusicPlayer />` component featuring play, pause, skip, volume, and download buttons.  
  - Handle audio load errors gracefully by displaying user-friendly error messages.

- **User Profile Page – `src/app/profile/page.tsx`:**
  - Display user information, favorite songs, and playlists.  
  - Render `<Playlist />` components; include edit/delete actions with clear error handling for failed API calls.

---

## 3. Component Development

- **Authentication Components:**
  - Create `src/components/Auth/LoginForm.tsx` and `src/components/Auth/SignupForm.tsx`:
    - Build responsive forms with input validations and clear error messaging.
    - Use Tailwind CSS for spacing, colors, and typography without relying on external icon libraries.

- **Core UI Components:**
  - **SearchBar (`src/components/SearchBar.tsx`):**
    - A modern, accessible search input paired with a text-based button.
  - **MusicPlayer (`src/components/MusicPlayer.tsx`):**
    - Use the HTML5 `<audio>` element and custom controls (play, pause, skip, download).
    - Implement error and loading states, e.g., if an audio file fails to load.
  - **Playlist (`src/components/Playlist.tsx`):**
    - Display playlists as card components with modern typography and spacing.
    - Provide functionality to add or remove songs.

## 4. API Endpoints and Services

- **API Endpoints (using Next.js App Router under `src/app/api`):**
  - **Authentication – `src/app/api/auth/route.ts`:**
    - Handle POST requests for signup and login. Validate request payloads and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
  - **Music Search & Streaming – `src/app/api/music/route.ts`:**
    - Accept GET requests with query parameters. Return mock music metadata and sample audio file URLs from `/public`.
    - Use try/catch blocks for robust error handling.
  - **Playlist Management – `src/app/api/playlist/route.ts`:**
    - Handle GET and POST requests for retrieving and updating user playlists.
    - Validate inputs and return detailed error messages in JSON.

- **Services – `src/services/api.ts`:**
  - Centralize API calls for authentication, search, and playlist management.
  - Implement error transformation logic, retries, and response normalization.

---

## 5. Database & Error Handling

- **Database Integration (Mock Data Demo):**
  - Create a stub file at `src/lib/db.ts` demonstrating future database integration (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB connection).
  
- **Error Handling Best Practices:**
  - Wrap all API endpoint logic in try/catch blocks.
  - Validate inputs on both front-end forms and backend endpoints.
  - Display user-friendly error messages on UI components (using Tailwind-styled alert boxes).

---

## 6. Testing and Deployment

- **Testing:**
  - **Unit Testing:**  
    - Write tests for each React component (LoginForm, SignupForm, MusicPlayer, etc.) using Jest and React Testing Library.
  - **Integration Testing:**  
    - Create tests in a `/tests` folder to run API endpoint tests with curl commands and verify responses.
  - **Sample Curl Test:**  
    ```bash
    # Test Music Search API
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/music?query=pop" -H "Content-Type: application/json"
    ```
- **Deployment:**
  - Update `README.md` with deployment instructions for Vercel or another cloud provider.
  - Ensure build scripts in `package.json` are set up and include environment variable configuration instructions.

---

## 7. UI/UX Considerations

- Use a minimalistic, modern design with ample whitespace, clear typography, and consistent spacing.
- Ensure all pages and components are responsive across mobiles, tablets, and desktops.
- Avoid external image services; if a landing page image is needed, use a placeholder with detailed `src` and `alt` attributes:
  ```html
  <img src="https://placehold.co/1920x1080?text=Modern+minimalist+landing+page+with+clear+typography" alt="A modern minimalist landing page displaying clear typography and spacious layout" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='fallback-image.jpg';" />
  ```

## Summary

- Created environment and global setup files (.env.local, tailwind.config.js, globals.css) to configure the project.
- New pages (Home, Search, Player, Profile) are added under `src/app`, each rendering required components.
- Authentication, MusicPlayer, SearchBar, and Playlist components are built in `src/components` with modern UI/UX using Tailwind CSS.
- API endpoints for authentication, music search, and playlist management are defined with error handling.
- A centralized service file (`src/services/api.ts`) manages API interactions.
- Testing and deployment instructions are provided in README with robust curl-based API testing.
